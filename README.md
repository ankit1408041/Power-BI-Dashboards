# Power-BI-Dashboards
Creating an Insightful dashboard to capture the progress of blast in an undergroung mines. Separate pages were made for Drilling Progress, Prep Progress and Loading Progress.

Tech stack 
* Power BI Desktop : Main data cisualization platform used for report creation
* Power Query : Data Transformation and cleaning
* Data Modelling : Relationships established between tables.

Data Source: 
* API calling through BlastIQ Server.

Features/Highlights:
* Business Problem: Blasting is a discrete process that includes Drilling the holes as per design, measuring it to ensure it matches the design and then loading with explosives. All these activities can continue for many shifts. Tracking of the progress of multiple blasts in different parts of a mine has always remained a challenge. Because of which too much of resources were under utilized

The main page of Dashboard looks like : https://github.com/ankit1408041/Power-BI-Dashboards/blob/main/BIQ%20UG%20Dashboard(Main%20Page).png
